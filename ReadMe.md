## Project Proposal

Our project is focused on trends in Pet Adoption or Treatment in Austin. Specifically, we're interested in time, location, name, age, and type/breed of animal as related to to adoption or intake.

There are several data files in data.world by Austin Animal Center statistics. Gmaps will be useful for visualization and organizing intake locations.
